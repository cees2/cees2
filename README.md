### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Damian and I'm a student of applied computer science at Cracow University of Technology. I'm looking for an internship as a front-end developer. I've created my portfolio web application which you can see below. This application is constantly developing by myself. In the future I would like to become a fullstack developer, so I am currently learning a backend technology: NodeJS. Feel free to explore my repos and contact me anytime.
